## Tables and Loops
- **Divisible.cs** - a program which selects numbers from 100 to 1 in descending order. They are divisible by 3, but indivisible by 2. Usage of 3 types of loops (for, while, do..while).<br/>
- **Table.cs** - an int table and filled with decreasing values from 10 to 1. Usage of for loop.<br/>
- **FibonacciTable.cs** - a two-dimensional table where values come from the Fibonacci sequence and are displayed.<br/>

## Overloading, Exception Handling
- **ConstructorsOverloading.cs** - a class which contains two fields: first - double type, second - char type. It has 5 overloaded constructors: first - receiving 1 double argument, second - 1 argument char type, third - 2 arguments: first double and second char, forth - 2 double arguments and it counts Euklides' NWD. Fifth constructor receives int table and counts sito of Erastotenes (prime numbers).<br/>
- **Exceptions.cs** - a program which presents informations of ArithmeticException and Exception.<br/>
- **BubbleSort.cs** - a program which takes from an user table with 10 integer numbers. In the constructor they are sorted by bubble method and returned to the main method.

## Input and Output Operations
- **CaesarCipher.cs** - a program which contains Caesar's cipher (modification by 1). It ciphers characters pressed directly from a keyboard.<br/>
- **QuadraticEquation.cs** - a program which resolves quadratic equation. Parameters come from an user's input.<br/>
- **PrimeNumbers.cs** - a program which lets an user type numbers separated by a comma and displays only prime numbers from them.<br/>

## Operations on Files
- **Quicksort.cs** - a program which creates a directory and a file with names from an user's input. In the file it puts a table of 10 integer's numbers sorted by the quicksort algorithm.<br/>
- **DeleteFileOrDirectory.cs** - a program which deletes a file or a directory. Program asks the user about confirmation of executing.<br/> 
- **SizeOfFiles.cs** - a program which displays total size of files from a directiory.<br/>
- **PiMonteCarlo.cs** - a program which counts an estimated value of PI using Monte Carlo method. Value is saved to a file.<br/>

## Generic Types, Interfaces
- **NWWInterface.cs** - a class which implements an interface. Interface contains a definition of NWW method and 2 numbers. In the main method is implemented NWW algorithm.<br/>
- **InsertionSort.cs** - the insertion sort with dynamical extending of table.<br/>
