**Tables and Loops:** <br/>
- **Divisible.cs** - write a program which selects numbers from 100 to 1 in descending order. They must be divisible by 3, but indivisible by 2. Use 3 types of loops (for, while, do..while). <br/>
- **Table.cs** - create an int table and fill it with decreasing values from 10 to 1. In order to make it use for loop. <br/>
- **FibonacciTable.cs** - create a two-dimensional table where values come from the Fibonacci sequence and display it.<br/>

**Overloading, Exception Handling:** <br/>
- **ConstructorsOverloading.cs** - write a class which contains 2 fields: first - double type, second - char type. Add 5 overloaded constructors: first - receiving 1 double argument, second - 1 argument char type, third - 2 arguments: first double and second char, forth - 2 double arguments and it counts Euklides' NWD. Fifth constructor receives int table and counts sito of Erastotenes (prime numbers). In the main method use them and write out states of variables.<br/>
- **Exceptions.cs** - write a program where will be selected 2 different exceptions (for exaample ArithmeticException and Exception).<br/>
- **BubbleSort.cs** - write a program which takes from an user table with 10 integer numbers.Convey it to constructor which will sort it by bubble method and return it to the main method. Use try-catch to capture exceptions (for instance IndexOutOfRangeException).<br/>

**Input and Output Operations:**
- **CaesarCipher.cs** - write a program which contains Caesar's cipher (modification by 1). It must cipher characters clicked directly from a keyboard.<br/>
- **QuadraticEquation.cs** - write a program which resolves quadratic equation. Parameters must come from an user's input.<br/>
- **PrimeNumbers.cs** - write a program which lets an user type numbers separated by a comma and displays only prime numbers from them.<br/>

**Operations on Files:**
- **Quicksort.cs** - write a program which creates a directory and a file (names come from an user's input). In the file it puts a table of 10 integer's numbers sorted by the quicksort algorithm.<br/>
- **DeleteFileOrDirectory.cs** - write a program which delets a file or a directory (name come from an user's input). Program must ask the user about confirmation of executing. <br/> 
- **SizeOfFiles.cs** - write a program which displays total size of files from a directiory (name come from an user's input).<br/>
- **PiMonteCarlo.cs** - write a program which counts an estimated value of PI using Monte Carlo method. Save the value to a file.<br/>

**Generic Types, Interfaces:**
- **NWWInterface.cs** - write a class which implements an interface. Interface must contains definition of NWW method and 2 numbers. In the main method implement NWW algorithm.<br/>
- **InsertionSort.cs** - the insertion sort with dynamical extending of a table.
